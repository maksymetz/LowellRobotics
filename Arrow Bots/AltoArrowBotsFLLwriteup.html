In response, she started the &nbsp;Alto Arrow Bots FLL team. The team started with five members the first year as they started to experiment with the FLL project. As word spread around Alto Elementary, thee team&rsquo;s meeting place, popularity skyrocketed the next year. By 2014 the Alto Arrow Bots had gained a team of nine students out of the 10 maximum ranging from fourth to seventh grade and decided to try a competition that year. The undertaking was immense; Mrs. Hudson was aide by Anderson Hudson from the Lowell Robotics Team as a mentor, as well as the parents of the members of the team. All of the members of the team learned about the NXT Mindstorms Lego robot, presenting and researching information, and teamwork skills. The team was incredibly enthusiastic about competition, and all of the team members had an amazing experience.In the end,the Alto Arrow Bots won the Presentation Award for their creative skit that focused on the cooncept out through the personification of computer dangers, like viruses. The mentor, Anderson Hudson, also won the Outstanding Young Mentor award in representation of the Lowell Red Arrow &nbsp;Robotics team.
