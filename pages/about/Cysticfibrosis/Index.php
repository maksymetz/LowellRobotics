<p>WHAT IS CYSTIC FIBROSIS?                   
 
CF (Cystic Fibrosis) is a genetic disease that causes the body to produce abnormally thick, sticky mucus leading to life-threatening lung infections. By investing in CF research, you are investing in improving the lives of those with the disease. Money buys science and science brings life. Through HFC (<a href="http://www.huntforacure.com/" target="_blank">Hunt for a Cure</a>) we can give the children and adults with CF the quality of life and future they deserve.</p>
