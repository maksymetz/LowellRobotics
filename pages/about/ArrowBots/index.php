CF (Cystic Fibrosis) is a genetic disease that causes the body to produce abnormally thick, sticky mucus leading to life-threatening lung infections. By investing in CF research, you are investing in improving the lives of those with the disease. Money buys science and science brings life. Through HFC (<a href="http://www.huntforacure.com/" target="_blank">Hunt for a Cure</a>) we can give the children and adults with CF the quality of life and future they deserve. Which is why we support Hunt for a Cure!</p>

<p><div class="titlebanner"><h2>WHAT IS IT LIKE LIVING WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS?</h2></div>
Living with Cystic Fibrosis isn't much different than living a normal life. The big difference is we take more medication and a percussion which is a machine that helps shake the mucus out of our lungs. This might seem like it's a lot and hard to remember to take all our pills, but it becomes our daily routine like brushing your teeth. For those who don't know what Cystic Fibrosis is, it's a genetic disease, so you can't catch it like a cold. It effects our lungs, which makes it hard to breathe. For an example, breathing it, we describe it like breathing through a straw, and we tend to cough a lot, which cough drops sadly don't help us. And the other thing it affects is the digestive system, so we take pills called enzymes. They help digest our food, the best part is it really doesn't have a taste because it's in plastic.
Now before you think "Oh their life must be horrible," remember to all negatives there's always a positive
<br>1. We have more of an excuse to live life to the fullest. 
<br>2. We get a different perspective of life.
<br>3. My personal favorite, we get to cut through any line we want in Disney World!
<br>I hope you understand CF is not the end of the world and it has benefits.
