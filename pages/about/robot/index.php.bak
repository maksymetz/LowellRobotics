<li>Drive Train - We decided to go with six wheels this year to improve handling sensitivity, and to increase pushing power we added a second motor to
				each CIM gear box. The main drive wheels are in the center of the frame and the omni-directional wheels are on the front and back. 
				All of the wheels are chain driven tank style. All of these changes from last year did exactly what we had hoped (improved pushing and handling),
				but the compromise for very fine control was a robot that is much more difficult to control on the field.</li>

<li>Battery Box - One of the major things that we learned from last year was where to put the battery box. Last year we placed the battery box on the 
				underside of the robot, and quickly learned that it was one of the worst places we could put it. For Logomotion we fashioned the battery box
				so that it sits vertically and in an easy to reach location.</li>

<li>Arm - Our arm is set up with an acme screw powered by a window motor to control the main pivot and a fisher price motor with a modified gearbox to control 
		the secondary pivot. We had to combine the fisher price motor with one of the new CIM gear boxes in order to get the gear ratio that we needed to 
		deliver enough holding torque to keep a game piece in the gripper without it sagging.</li>

<li>Gripper - The gripper is made from 1/4" aluminum rod that is bent into the shape that we need. It is held shut with a short piece of surgical tubing. 
			This mechanism is opened by another acme screw and gear motor.</li>

<img src="img/bumpers.jpg" class="newspic" style="max-width:150px;" alt="Page Under Construction!" />
<li>Bumpers - Another major problem that we had last year was our bumpers were very difficult to change. This year we modified last year's bumpers with c-channel 
			and drop-in pins to make them easier and faster to replace during matches.</li>

<li>Controls - The control scheme is set up for two drivers. One controls the arm and one controls the driving. We will be setting up limits in the code that 
			take readings from the encoders and keep the arm from extending past the 72 inch limit.</li>

<img src="img/limitSwitches.jpg" class="newspic" style="float:left; max-width:150px;" alt="Page Under Construction!" />
<li>Limit Switches - In our initial test run we had problems with not being able to judge the arm position accurately resulting in the acme screw at the base of the
					arm getting bound up multiple times. Limit switches have been added to the arm to keep the driver in a safe position and to prevent 
					this problem during matches.</li>

<li>Autonomous - Currently our autonomous is just a simple line follower. Before matches start wee will be adding arm/encoder control for the three tube heights.
				This will allow us to score with the uber-tube in any position on the scoring rack.</li>

<img src="img/minibot" class="newspic" style="max-width:150px;" alt="Page Under Construction!" />
<li>Minibot - Our minibot is powered by the two motors that came in the Tetrix kit. Instead of using the NXT controller we are planning on using just a household
			light switch to allow the minibot to achieve a controlled decent without the extra weight from the NXT. The wheels are 5 inch diameter machined aluminum
			with high friction material to help them grip the pole. A spring is used with a mechanical trigger the clamp onto the pole at the end of the match.</li>

<li>Minibot Deployment - The minibot is elevated on a platform to get it up to the 18 inch limit for deployment. Everything is attached to a plate that is on a pair 
						of ball	bearing slides for fast deployment. This plate is tapered at the center and is on a pivot at the other end. By designing it in this
						way we can ensure that even if we aren't straight on the pole for the finale we will still be able to deploy quickly and accurately.</li>
