<li>This year’s goal was to launch a large exercise ball into a goal. To launch the ball we had a catapult-like mechanism powered by motors and chains. The drive train was composed of four omni wheels and two traction wheels. This robot brought us to second place at Gull Lake.</li>

<li>This year’s goal was to shoot Frisbees and climb a three level pyramid in the end game. To shoot the Frisbees we had a mechanism that composed of a wheel mounted between steel and polycarbonate that would launch the Frisbees out of the robot. To climb the pyramid, there was a hook that connected to the base of the robot. The drive train was composed of 6 traction wheels. This robot brought us to the quarter finals of states!</li>

<li>This year’s goal was to place inflatable’s on a scoring rack. The main drive wheels are in the center of the frame and the omni-directional wheels are on the front and back. Our arm is set up with an acme screw powered by a window motor to control the main pivot and a fisher price motor with a modified gearbox to control the secondary pivot. Our minibot is powered by the two motors that came in the Tetrix kit. The wheels are 5 inch diameter machined aluminum with high friction material. The minibot is elevated on a platform to get it up to the 18 inch limit for deployment. This robot took us to states.</li>
