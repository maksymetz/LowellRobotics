<h2>Recruitment, WMRI, and Homecoming</h2>
</div>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Sept. 21 2011</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have seen us last night at the middle school. We were trying to get new junior members in hopes of getting them absorbed into the
atmosphere and interested in continuing with the competition once they get into high school.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are indeed going to be at the West Michigan Robotics Invitational next month. We encourage anyone interested in our team to come and see
what happens at our competitions. It should be alot of fun!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finaly, we will be putting a float into the homecoming parade. You might even see our robot more than once!</p>

<h2>Team Update:  West Michigan District</h2>
</div>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Mar. 12 2011</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our team improved greatly at this district event. We were seeded seventh and got to choose an alliance as the 5th alliance captains. Our alliance
was fantastic due to new scouting efforts. In our first elimination match, we experienced some technical difficulties. In our second, we scored higher and would have won,
but we were given a red card for a human player de-scoring a tube. At the end of the competition, we had 59 points toward the state championship. That gives us a chance
to go on.</p>

<h2>Team Update:  Waterford Competition</h2>
</div>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Mar. 12 2011</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We finished 7th after the qualifying rounds were completed. We became the captains of the 6th alliance and were knocked out in the quarter-finals
after two losses. We learned a great deal from this competition and will strive to fix items of concern for next week.</p>

<h2>Team Update:  Final Touches</h2>
</div>


<span style="font-weight:bold;">Feb. 12 2011</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finishing touches are usually some of the hardest. The gripper is now functioning. Encoders and limit switches have been placed on almost every 
motorized part of the robot. The programmers worked hard to utilize all of the new sensors to their fullest. Now little tweaks and a lot of practice will be our best 
friends until it's time to bag up the robot and prepare for competition.</p>

<h2>Team Update:  We Have a Robot</h2>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Feb. 9 2011</span>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With only a few weeks left of the build season; our efficiency compared to last year is already evident. Not only do we already have a functioning robot, which 
is a feat in itself, but we have driven it on multiple occasions, and the arm which will be used to pick up tubes is nearly complete. In fact, a lot of what we've been working on 
lately has been merely tweaks, touch-ups, and updates.
	<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our mottos throughout this build has been to keep everything as simple as possible, and we achieved just that in the minibot deployment system. Our set-up involves 
two drawer slides raised above the control panel by a metal platform. When a switch is lifted, the deployment tray springs out, and the wheels of the minibot snap 
around and attach to the pole on contact. They'll already be spinning at this point, allowing for a swift ascent.
	<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An addition to the robot that we're all grateful for is the new bumper system. We're using the same bumpers as were used last year, but the new attachment system 
we've come up with is much more convenient. Last year, there were bolts connected to the back of the bumpers, so when it came time to switch colors, team members had 
to reach up into the robot to unscrew the knuts, often working blind. Now, however, all we have to do is slide the bumpers on and off using modified u-channel and drop 
pins to keep them in place.
	<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, the robot is really coming together. We're just finishing the arm, which will be able to pick up tubes from both the front and back. The programmers have 
been working diligently on autonomous code, and they have basic controls coded with plans to include encoders. It's hard to believe that this robot was once nothing more 
than a box of parts. We look forward to competitions, to seeing how other teams have assembled their robots, to enjoying yet another season of all FIRST has to offer.

<h2>Team Update:  Driving</h2>
</div>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Feb. 5 2011</span>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our most major improvement since two weeks ago? We can now drive the robot! Last week was our first run. Since then, we've been setting up the arm 
motors. We have the control board design complete as well, although it hasn't been attached yet.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress on the minibot has gone well; we now have a prototype with wheels that clamp on to the pole when the release is triggered. There is no 
deployment system created as of now, but designs have been drawn to have a tray that slides out. The tray will have a triangualar notch cut out of it, so that it will 
center itself on the pole.

<h2>Team Update:  Arm Dexterity</h2>
</div>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Jan. 22 2011</span>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some major elements of our robot are taking shape, and our robot is finally starting to resemble an actual, well, robot! We now have an arm; 
although there is not yet a motor attached, we have br/ought the robot out into the the school hallway along with the scoring rack to test it out, simulating how 
it will move within the space restrictions. While one student guides the robot, one or two others operate the arm and the gripper prototype, picking up tubes manually 
and hanging them on our PVC contraption. This will help us to choose to tilt the gripper or not.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, we decided to flip over our frame over so that the rock was minimized. Although the robot still tips ever so slightly from front 
to back, it's not quite as dramatic. It was also decided that we would connect the omni wheels to the center drive wheels, creating an all wheel drive and making it 
less likely that we will get stuck. The control board is also beginning to come together. We're on a roll!

<h2>Team Update:  Drive Train</h2>
</div>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Jan. 15 2011</span>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, not much has been done on the actual robot as we are still testing our ideas and checking our calculations when it comes to torque and such. 
However, we've takent eh frame from last year's robot and added six wheels; two traction wheels in the center on each side with four omniwheels (two on the front and 
two on the back.) One way, the robot has some rock to it, while the other way the rock is minor and we're experimenting with which way to flip it. Having some tip to 
robot would ensure that we'd always have the traction wheels on the ground, thus preventing the robot from being stuck on a popped tube or something similar.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we do not have much of the robot built, we've already completed the scoring rack and the minibot pole for when it comes time to test 
our robot. For now, we'll just keep plugging away at our design!

<h2>Team Update: Kickoff</h2>
</div>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Jan. 8 2011</span>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, do we have an exciting task ahead of us! Seeing as this is only our second year of competition, we were really looking forward to learning this 
year's competition, we were really looking forward to learning what this year's game would be like. Now that we've attended the kick-off, our gears are already spinning 
with ideas.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our initial thought, in order to keep our robot as simple as possible, was to reuse the frame concept from last year. That way we'd have the 
same dimensions and wouldn't have to make new bumpers. We're determined to be more efficient than we were last year when we weren't quite sure how to go about doing 
everything. We also came up with the idea of using 6 wheel for reasons of traction and turn precision.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the arm, the decision is not yet set in stone. The current issue is determining how long each section of the arm will be so that it can 
reach to either the front or back of the robot while staying in the required 84 inches. Going along with that, we've decided that we want to build a simple gripper with 
thre or four prongs to pick up the tubes.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task is daunting, yet we can't wait for the challenge!
